# Handover notes

## Where is stuff?

People often ask the clergy (because we are the people they think will *know*) where all kinds of stuff is. The answer, except in the unusual case where something is still where *we* put it and want it to be, is "It's wherever Someone has put it." Look for it in the place we would like it to be, and if it's not there, make the person who asked the question look for it. They will find it in the last place they look.

## Advent

The holder for Advent candles is on the top shelf of the robes cupboard in the clergy vestry.

Advent candles should be ordered in good time (October) 1" x 12" fluted base. In an emergency you may be able to get some at St Andrew's Bookshop. (This applies to other items on this list - the other emergency source is the Cathedral Shop.)

## Lent

Prepare ash *before* Ash Wednesday. This is a tedious and slow business - you may find ways of doing it more easily than I have (I was never taught.) Burn last year's palm crosses by holding each one individually in a candle flame until it is thoroughly burnt, and catch the ash in an ash tray before mashing it into a fine powder with a teaspoon. The resulting ash should be mixed with a very small amount of olive oil.

**Palm crosses**. Order them in January/February from [African Palms](http://africanpalms.co.uk/). They usually send a postcard around that time. Don't sit on it and risk losing the card, fill it in and post it immediately. (Though if you do lose the card, you can order online.)

## Easter

Order paschal candle in good time, around the beginning of Lent.

## Marston Times
Some vicars plan the preaching rota months in advance: I never managed more than for the following month. Do this in good time before the Marston Times deadline.

## Supplies and suppliers

* [D M Hay](http://www.dmhay.com/)
They are good for phone or online orders, we have an account reference OX3 0PR and they have sometimes delivered to James Lawrie; we may need to register a different account if we want stuff delivered to a different address.
I have bought Communion wine, wafers, cruets, purificators, Advent candles from them.

Order toner as required, and paper. Users don't always remember to tell you when paper is running low, so a regular check is desirable, especially in the run-up to Christmas or other times when we will need to do lots of copying.
Paul, one of their engineers, lives in Marston and is often able to respond to a call-out in less than hour.


## Checks before services

Good practice: arrive at least 30 minutes before the service is due to start. Check:

* Lights all switched on, including front of S aisle lights, controlled by switch beside lectern.
* Heating on?
    - Storage heaters: Switched on as needed, chiefly October to April
    - Heater above entrance door before and at end of service.
    - The central section of pew heaters is controlled from the timer box in the old vestry. Learn how this works! The override switch is a small red button at about '4 o'clock' which needs to be pushed in towards the centre. The main on-off switch for the pew heaters is in the white box to the right of the timer.
    - North aisle pew heater switch (independent of timer) is at the E. end of the aisle to right of storage heater.
    - Chancel pew heater switches: L and R beside clergy stalls; 2 switches behind altar.
* Audio system on?
* Are all the people on rotas to do things present? Server, lesson readers, intercessors, chalice assistants? Get a churchwarden (if one is present) to check on this and be ready to cover, or delegate to someone else.
* Enter service details in the register **before** the service, else the money counters don't know where to write their figures.
* In general, be **meticulous** about record keeping (registers of services, weddings, baptisms, burials, other records). This is a legal requirement, and a bother to sort out later if we omit to do it at the time. Do it before leaving church after the service if at all possible; it is so easy to forget if you 'just leave it till later.'

## At the end of the service
* Make sure someone has a key to lock the safe and the vestry when the collection has been counted and Communion vessels put away.
* Turn off all the heaters not controlled by the timer, i.e. pew heaters in N aisle, chancel, and behind altar.

## The clock
The venerable vestry clock has to be wound once a week. The key hangs in the key safe. Only the lowest of the three keyholes is to be wound (the other two relate to the chimes which are not in use). If the clock has stopped completely, tip it slightly to one side to get the pendulum started.
In an ideal world, find someone who will be there every week to be responsible for winding the clock. (This generally means, one of the clergy.)

## Parish charities
* Workmen's Hall Fund
The incumbent is ex officio chair of trustees. Alan Hughes is the secretary and treasurer. Trustees meet once a year, and may consider grants at other times via email or a special meeting.
* Marston Charities
Managed by the Parish Council: the vicar is an ex officio trustee
* Brett's Charity
Pays for many of the costs of Elsfield Village Room, and makes grants to various other local charities. The incumbent is ex officio chair of trustees. Richard Brown is the secretary and treasurer, Kate White the other trustee.
* Webb Trust
The incumbent is ex officio chair of trustees. Carolyn Brown is the main correspondent. The charity has struggled to get recognition following a claim that it had ceased to exist. It has proved difficult to re-establish its existence.

## Records, record-keeping, statutory requirements
[See also the comments above]
There are the statutory records that we are required to keep:

* Registers of baptisms, marriages, burials, and banns. All of these registers for Marston and Elsfield are kept in the safe at Marston because there is no secure storage in Elsfield church.
It may be possible to find someone with a fair hand to complete these registers, but it's important to record each event immediately, which means that unless the clerk is always on site, the clergy need to do it. In a vacancy the wardens probably share responsibility for seeing that it's done: please help officiating clergy to do this, especially if they are visitors who may not know where the registers are.
* Quarterly returns of marriages must be sent to the Register Office (photocopies of marriage entries are now acceptable, with a certificate signed, I think, by the Area Dean - although curate may be OK to sign: check on this. A nil return, if there have been no weddings) The Register Office send out reminders when these returns should be made.
* Service registers. Carolyn Brown holds the Elsfield register and brings it to church with her. I don't think these need to be kept in the safe.
* Pastoral records. Keep lists of funerals conducted (names and addresses of next of kin) to invite them to the annual Memorial Service, held on first Sunday evening of November. Send invitations out in October.
Other pastoral records have been kept more informally as each minister finds helpful, e.g. records of visits, funerals, baptisms.
* Be aware of other records that need to be kept securely, e.g.annual reports, audit and financial reports, and historical items have to be kept indefinitely. Registers over 100 years old should be deposited with the County Records Office. 

## Servers

## Bellringers
It's important, and good, to encourage our bellringers. The Marston tower is one of the most active in the diocese. The vicar chairs the AGM which takes place every January.

## Annual Memorial Service

## Remembrance Sunday

## Safeguarding
The safeguarding officer is Millius Palayiwa, who will hold all the files relating to DBS checks, and on the Agreement(s) in force with regard to registered sex offender(s) who belong to the church.
Always contact the Diocesan Safeguarding Officer about any issues:
Stephen Barber
01865 208290

## Security system
The roof alarm system is operated by 
UBX Security
0871 200 1999
01458 250999
I'm not sure whether our contract is up to date? Check on this.

The code for the panel in the ringing chamber is 2580
The panel then tells you whether the alarm has been silenced, etc. If the system is off, you need to enter the code again, and if the message is 'Activate all areas' (or some such) enter Yes. After 15 seconds a bleep tells you the system is on.


## Vicarage security system
This is the only place we have ever lived where we have been burgled - twice. But it was a long time ago, and not since the diocese installed a security system
This is paid for by the diocese, and operated by ADT
0844 800 1999
Contract number: 084047
5-letter password: LEMON
They visit for a routine inspection every 6 months. They send a reminder letter when the inspection is due.

The master code for the box in the hall is *[I will put this in when we move!]*

## Funerals
Usually the first we hear about a funeral is when a funeral director phones. Funeral directors are to be encouraged not to arrange times and dates for funerals without contacting the parish clergy first. That said, we want to help them all we can, which means always trying to be available for funerals when asked, even if it involves cancelling or re-arranging another appointment. (This does not apply to taking a funeral on one's day off which should *never* be done.) 

It's important to have and use an answerphone, and I sometimes return a call from a funeral director even on my day off.

All of the funeral directors we have to deal with are excellent and most helpful. The chief ones are

* S & R Childs
01865 427272
* Cooperative Funerals
Headington 01865 308581
* Reeves & Pain
01865 242529


## Fees for funerals, weddings, churchyard memorials
All cheques should be made payable to
PCC of St Nicholas Marston
Cheques sent or given to Treasurer monthly, with request for any expenses payable. (Ask Alan Hughes how he would like this done.)


## Policies on baptisms and marriage

### Geoff's comments
Very helpful. A few random thoughts, nothing urgent:
1) will Millius have all the DBS paperwork?
2) contact details for the roof security system?
3) We should appoint a PCC lay chair after the next AGM, deputy would also be useful in case of absence
4) do we have written policies on baptism and marriage of divorced persons, blessings of civil partnerships and the like? It would be helpful if we can refer to existing policy rather than having to invent new
4) contacts in connections with occasional offices, especially funeral directors, organists, clergy - in general a copy of all relevant names addresses, emails, phone numbers would be very useful
